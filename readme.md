# Week 9 - Portfolio Tasks

## Instructions for use

App is a Chat box display where contributers must be added to the Member list.
- Add yourself to the list
- Click "View the Chat box" to begin chatting 

### Future improvements

- Any user can choose any author, obviously addition of some login functionality would be a good idea
- Admin functionality, with the ability for an admin to delete messages
- 

## Part 1. Create a basic Django app that includes:

- Two models defined in models.py
- sqlite3 database (with migrated Models)
- Two routes/views in views.py
- Views can return HTTP Response or render a template
- Appropriate config of URLs

## Part 2: Further develop the Django app in Part 1 to include:

- The use of a Template
- Pass some data from Model to Template e.g. Users.objects.all()
- Enable Django's Admin feature by creating a superuser
- Add your Models to the Admin feature
